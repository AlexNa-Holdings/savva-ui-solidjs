# What we do

- **Open stack** for communities to run their own networks.
- **Modern UX** with domain-level theming and assets.
- **Creator tools**: subscriptions, post funds (game-like rewards), NFTs, promotions.
- **Governance**: on-chain config and voting by stakers.
- **Interoperable**: networks share the same tokenomics but keep their culture.
