## Blockchain Authorization

All authors within the system are authorized through the cryptographic security of blockchain technology. Instead of confirming the actual identity of the author, blockchain authorization verifies that the author possesses the private key associated with their account. This cryptographic process ensures that it is practically impossible for anyone to post content on behalf of another individual, unless they possess the genuine private key.

In essence, blockchain authorization provides an unforgeable link between an author and their actions on the platform. When an author joins the system or contributes content, the blockchain verifies the ownership of the private key, guaranteeing that only those who genuinely possess the key can perform actions on the platform in their name.

This cryptographic approach not only safeguards against impersonation but also enhances the overall security and integrity of the network. It creates a trustless environment where content contributions and interactions are securely tied to the rightful owner of the private key, offering a high level of confidence and assurance to all participants in the network.
