## Content control

Content control is a critical aspect of any online community, and at SAVVA, we understand its importance. That's why we empower network administrators with comprehensive control over the content published on their networks.

This control is crucial because it allows administrators to curate and maintain the quality and relevance of the content within their communities. It ensures that the network aligns with its intended purpose and provides a safe and enjoyable experience for its members.

With SAVVA, administrators have the necessary tools to manage published content effectively. They can remove unwanted posts, block undesirable users, and maintain the integrity of their network. These features are particularly valuable for publicly accessible social networks, as they help uphold community standards and ensure a positive environment for all users.

Furthermore, SAVVA not only caters to publicly available networks but also provides the flexibility to run non-publicly accessible networks. In both cases, the administrator of the SAVVA network assumes full responsibility for the content published on their public network. This accountability underscores our commitment to fostering responsible content management and community governance.

At SAVVA, we believe in giving administrators the control they need to create thriving and well-managed communities while upholding the values and guidelines they set for their networks.
