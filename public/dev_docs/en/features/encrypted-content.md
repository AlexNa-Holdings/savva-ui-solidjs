## Encrypted Content Distribution

SAVVA introduces an advanced encrypted content distribution feature that empowers authors with control over who can access their content. With this feature, authors can specify precisely who is granted access to their content, ensuring that it remains private or accessible to a select audience.

Authors have the flexibility to define access criteria, such as allowing access exclusively to their supporters, who may contribute a specific amount of tokens on a weekly basis. This approach provides a powerful mechanism for creators to reward and incentivize their loyal followers while safeguarding the exclusivity of their content.

It's important to note that while the server infrastructure for this feature is fully operational and ready, the user interface (UI) implementation is currently in development and will be available in future releases. This exciting addition to the SAVVA platform will further enhance the content distribution options, offering creators a valuable tool to customize and monetize their content while maintaining control over its accessibility.
