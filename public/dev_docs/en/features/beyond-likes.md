## Beyond Likes Social Networks

SAVVA-based social networks provide users with a diverse range of ways to express their support for content creators. In addition to the traditional 'likes' and reactions, users can utilize the SAVVA token for various forms of author contributions and donations.

The SAVVA platform comes equipped with several smart contracts that implement various monetization methods, such as the Content Fund, Patreon-like subscriptions, content promotion tools, full-scale NFT support for posts (including an integrated NFT marketplace), and more.

Because of the open and extensible nature of the system, social network administrators have the flexibility to introduce additional features and monetization methods tailored to their community's needs and interests. This adaptability ensures that creators and their supporters have a dynamic and customizable platform where innovation and community-driven support take center stage, ultimately recognizing and rewarding creators for their valuable contributions.
