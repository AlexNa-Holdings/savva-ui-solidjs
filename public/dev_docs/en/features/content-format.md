## Content Format

SAVVA introduces an extended open content format that expands the possibilities of content creation and distribution. While the initial user interface (UI) release supports the extended Markdown format only, it's essential to note that the specification is open and flexible, allowing for the distribution of virtually any type of content in the future.

The extended Markdown support for posts is remarkably advanced, going beyond the basics. It includes:

Multi-Lingual Support: Authors can create content in multiple languages, making it accessible to a diverse global audience.

Embedded Video and Audio: Authors can seamlessly integrate video and audio elements into their posts, enhancing the multimedia experience for readers.

One of the standout features of our extended content format is the 'Chapters Support.' This innovative feature enables authors to create multi-chapter posts and even add new chapters to content that has already been published. This functionality is particularly beneficial for various applications:

* Book Serialization: Authors can publish their books chapter by chapter, engaging readers with serialized content.
* Comprehensive Guides: Users can present short introductory posts, followed by detailed articles in subsequent chapters, providing step-by-step instructions or in-depth explanations.
* Project Building: For creators, posts can serve as introductions to their projects, with subsequent chapters offering detailed instructions on how followers can replicate or build similar projects themselves.


SAVVA's extended open content format is designed to inspire creativity, facilitate comprehensive communication, and provide a versatile platform for content creators. It encourages the distribution of knowledge, stories, and ideas in a flexible and user-friendly manner, fostering a rich and dynamic content ecosystem.
