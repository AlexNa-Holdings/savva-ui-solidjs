# Core Concepts

This section covers the core architecture of the SAVVA SolidJS app: how it connects to the backend, how domains and assets work, how UI is driven by per‑domain configuration, and more.

What we’ll cover:

- How the app boots and finds the correct backend & domain
- How `/info` drives runtime behavior (domains, chain ID, IPFS gateways, assets)
- How domain assets are resolved and when the default pack is used
