# SAVVA Developer Documentation

Welcome to the **SAVVA Platform** developer docs.

---

## What is SAVVA?

SAVVA is an **open-source platform** for building next-generation social networks.  
Unlike traditional platforms, SAVVA combines **blockchain** and **IPFS** to create a decentralized, trustable, and censorship-resistant foundation.

- **Blockchain-anchored posts**  
  Every piece of content is registered on-chain and signed with the author’s cryptographic key. This ensures authenticity and makes it possible to trust that the post truly comes from its stated author.

- **Decentralized storage with IPFS**  
  Content is stored in the InterPlanetary File System rather than in a single company’s database. This removes single points of failure and makes the system more resilient.

Together, blockchain and IPFS form a new kind of social network: one without centralized control, without a single company behind it, and without a pressure point that can be exploited.

## About This Documentation

This is **developer documentation**, not end-user help.  
SAVVA is open source, and we actively encourage developers to fork, extend, and adapt the codebase.  

Here you’ll find:

- The **core principles** behind the architecture.  
- How the **interfaces and APIs** are structured.  
- Best practices for extending and integrating the platform.

If you are a developer exploring SAVVA, this is the place to start. 🚀
