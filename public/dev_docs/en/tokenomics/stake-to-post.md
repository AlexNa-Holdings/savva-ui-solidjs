## Stake to post

Within SAVVA's public social networks, the platform promotes a unique and user-centric approach to content creation and engagement. While the content itself is generally accessible to everyone (unless explicitly protected by the author), the ability to actively participate by writing posts or comments is tied to a staking requirement.

Here's how it works:

To post content or engage in discussions by leaving comments, users are required to stake a certain amount of SAVVA tokens. Importantly, these tokens are not deducted or taken from the user's possession; instead, users need to stake the necessary amount in the staking contract to gain posting privileges.

The specific amount required for staking is determined and controlled by the governance contract of the platform. This mechanism ensures that the staking requirement remains flexible and responsive to the evolving needs and decisions of the SAVVA community. Governance allows users to collectively influence and adjust the staking thresholds, reflecting the values and objectives of the platform.

This approach aligns with the platform's commitment to active user engagement and community-driven decision-making. It encourages responsible and thoughtful contributions while ensuring that users can maintain control over their own tokens without them being permanently deducted from their accounts. It's a system that fosters a vibrant and dynamic content ecosystem while empowering the SAVVA community to shape its own rules and requirements.
