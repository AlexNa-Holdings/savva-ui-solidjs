## Post funds

The Post Fund feature on the SAVVA platform introduces a captivating and engaging way to support authors and participate in a rewarding game-like experience. Each post within the system can have its dedicated Post Fund, offering users an innovative approach to show their appreciation while having fun.

Here's how the Post Fund operates, including the possibility of multiple winners:

* `Donations and Support:` Users who enjoy a particular post and wish to support the author can transfer SAVVA tokens into the Post Fund associated with that post. Approximately 5% of this transfer goes directly to the author, ensuring that the author receives immediate recognition and support for their work.

* `Game of Chance with Multiple Winners:` The remaining portion of the transfer is collected in the fund, and this collected amount becomes part of an exciting game. At a later point, this fund is distributed to winners through a series of rounds, introducing the possibility of multiple winners. The selection process is designed to be fair, transparent, and engaging, providing users with a thrilling and dynamic experience.

Two essential principles govern this process:

* `Transparent Voluntary Donation:` The donation part of the transfer is explicitly explained as a voluntary contribution to the author, separate from the game process. This ensures that authors receive direct support from appreciative users.

* `Zero-Sum, Honest Game:` The game of selecting winners from the collected fund is conducted in a zero-sum, honest manner. The system does not collect any fees or profits from this game, maintaining fairness and transparency in reward distribution.

With the possibility of multiple winners, the Post Fund feature not only encourages support for authors but also adds excitement and a sense of community within the SAVVA ecosystem. It offers users a unique and interactive way to engage with content creators and fellow community members.
