## Patreon like subscriptions

The SAVVA platform offers users the flexibility to configure periodical donations to their favorite authors, akin to the popular Patreon system. This feature allows users to specify the amount they wish to donate and the duration of their support. However, there are several unique and innovative twists to this feature:

* `Conditional Donations`: Authors will receive the scheduled donations only if they continue to actively post content on the platform. This dynamic approach ensures that supporters' contributions are directly linked to the author's ongoing engagement. Authors can even preview the immediate token rewards they'll receive for a new post before publishing it.

* `Tiered Access:` Authors can leverage the levels of donations to create tiered content access. For instance, they can choose to make certain content available exclusively to users who donate a specified minimum amount. This allows authors to reward their most dedicated supporters with premium or exclusive content.

These innovative twists on the Patreon-like subscription system not only empower authors to tailor their content and interactions but also encourage a stronger sense of community and support within the SAVVA platform. It's a feature that not only benefits content creators but also enhances the experience for their dedicated supporters.
