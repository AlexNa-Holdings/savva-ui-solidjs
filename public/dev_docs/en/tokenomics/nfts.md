## SAVVA NFT's

The SAVVA platform empowers authors to mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for their posts, adding an extra layer of uniqueness and value to select content. While not every post may warrant an NFT, there are special moments where authors and their followers may want to own a unique digital asset representing a particular piece of content. Here are two key aspects of the NFT implementation:

* `NFT and Post Fund Donations:` When a post has an associated NFT, the NFT owner receives a portion of the donations transferred to the post fund. This means that the total percentage allocated for the donation part of the post fund is increased. In practice, this results in a larger portion of the post fund donations going to the author when they themselves mint an NFT for their post. It offers an additional incentive for authors to create NFTs, as it increases their potential earnings from the post fund.

* `NFT Owner Contributions:` When an NFT owner contributes tokens to the post fund, the entire amount is directed into the fund. None of these tokens are allocated to the author or the NFT owner themselves. This design encourages NFT owners to actively participate in increasing the post fund, ultimately benefiting the author. By incentivizing NFT owners to help grow the post fund, it fosters a dynamic ecosystem where users are motivated to contribute to the post for a chance to participate in the rewarding game, resulting in increased donations available for the author.

These features enhance the value of NFTs on the SAVVA platform by aligning the interests of NFT owners, authors, and the broader community. They encourage the creation and ownership of NFTs while fostering a supportive environment where all participants can benefit from increased engagement and contributions.

The SAVVA platform introduces an integrated NFT marketplace, allowing NFT owners to seamlessly sell their digital assets within the system. Additionally, users have the opportunity to curate and organize their NFT collections. This feature offers a compelling and engaging experience for both NFT owners and their followers.

Here's how it works:

* `NFT Marketplace:` NFT owners can list their NFTs for sale directly within the SAVVA platform. This convenient marketplace enables NFT transactions to occur within the ecosystem, providing a streamlined and user-friendly process for buying and selling digital collectibles.

* `NFT Collection Organization:` Users have the ability to create and manage NFT collections. This feature transforms the process of organizing NFTs into an exciting and enjoyable experience. It allows users to curate their favorite NFTs, creating a direct and personal connection to their favorite authors and their unique digital creations.

By implementing these features, the SAVVA platform not only supports the NFT ecosystem but also enhances the relationship between creators and their followers. NFT owners can showcase their digital art, creations, and collectibles, while users can engage more deeply with their favorite authors and their NFT collections, fostering a stronger sense of community and appreciation within the platform.
