## SAVVA Token

The SAVVA Token serves as the fundamental utility token of the SAVVA platform, powering a wide array of essential operations and interactions within the ecosystem. Users rely on the SAVVA Token for various activities, including:

* Posting Messages: Users utilize SAVVA Tokens to post messages and content within the platform.
* Supporting Authors: The token enables users to make donations and show support to their favorite content creators and authors.
* Purchasing NFTs: SAVVA Tokens are used for acquiring Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the platform, allowing users to own and trade unique digital assets.

Beyond these examples, SAVVA Tokens facilitate a multitude of other operations and transactions that enrich the user experience.

It's important to emphasize that the SAVVA Token is not classified as a security token and is not associated with any specific company or business entity. Instead, it serves as a versatile tool for users to engage with the platform's features, participate in the ecosystem, and support content creators. This distinction ensures that the SAVVA Token remains a utility-driven asset within the SAVVA network, promoting user engagement, content creation, and the broader goals of the platform.

### Initial Token Distribution

The initial distribution of SAVVA Tokens will be facilitated through a bridge that allows users to transfer their old SAVVA tokens from the CyberWay blockchain to the new SAVVA platform. It's worth noting that the SAVVA platform has its origins in the well-established social network known as stihi.io, which was built on the CyberWay blockchain. Stihi.io is a vibrant social website catering to the Russian poetry community and has been in operation for many years.

SAVVA's development journey has strong ties to stihi.io, where numerous SAVVA concepts and ideas were initially conceived, tested, and refined. Within the CyberWay network, there exist hundreds of token holders who have contributed to the success of the platform.

The existing SAVVA Token, which has maintained a non-inflationary supply, currently stands at `172,038,868.70 tokens`. At the launch of the SAVVA platform, we will provide a bridge that allows existing token holders to transfer their old SAVVA tokens to the new platform on a 1:1 basis. Importantly, no new tokens will be generated or added to the total token supply at the platform's launch.

This approach ensures a smooth and fair transition for the existing SAVVA community, maintaining the integrity of the token ecosystem while introducing new and exciting features and capabilities on the SAVVA platform.

Additionally, it's important to note that the bridge will be operational for a period of `six months` from the platform's launch. During this time, existing token holders will have the opportunity to claim and transfer their old SAVVA tokens to the new platform.

However, after the six-month period expires, any old SAVVA tokens that have not been claimed and transferred by the holders will be subject to `token burning`. This means that unclaimed tokens will be permanently removed from circulation, ensuring the continued integrity of the token ecosystem and aligning with our commitment to maintaining a fair and balanced distribution of SAVVA Tokens on the new platform.
