## Staking

The SAVVA platform introduces a robust staking mechanism that allows token holders to maximize their participation and involvement within the ecosystem. By transferring their SAVVA tokens into the staking contract, users gain access to two key benefits:

* `Collect Newly Minted Tokens:` Stakers have the opportunity to participate in the collection of newly minted SAVVA tokens, which are generated through the 'Ongoing Sacrifice' mechanism. This means that stakers can earn additional tokens over time, further enhancing their stake in the SAVVA ecosystem.

* `Participate in Governance:` Staking also grants users the privilege of participating in the governance of the platform. This involvement enables stakers to have a say in important decisions and proposals that impact the platform's future development and direction. By actively participating in governance, users can help shape the platform's policies, features, and community initiatives.

The staking feature on the SAVVA platform not only offers users a means to increase their token holdings but also empowers them to play an active role in the platform's decision-making processes. It encourages engagement, contribution, and alignment of interests, creating a more dynamic and user-driven ecosystem.
