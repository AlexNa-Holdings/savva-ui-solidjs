## Buy and Burn

The SAVVA platform introduces an innovative two-token approach to support various content-promotion features. While the primary author support is facilitated using the SAVVA token, some promotional services within the platform require payment in the blockchain's basic token, PLS. This two-token system enables the implementation of a 'buy and burn' process, creating a unique value proposition for the SAVVA token.

Here's how it works:

* `Two-Token Approach:` The platform operates with two tokens, SAVVA and PLS. While SAVVA tokens are primarily used for author support and content-related transactions, PLS tokens serve as the blockchain's basic token.

* `Buy and Burn Process:` When users pay for promotional services using PLS tokens, all the collected PLS tokens are transferred to a 'buy and burn' contract. This contract then initiates a process where it purchases SAVVA tokens from a decentralized exchange (DEX) using the collected PLS tokens. Once acquired, the SAVVA tokens are systematically burned, permanently removing them from circulation.

The 'buy and burn' process is designed to create scarcity and value for the SAVVA token, aligning with the platform's long-term sustainability goals. It also provides an avenue for PLS token holders to contribute to the platform's ecosystem and participate in a deflationary mechanism that benefits both tokens.

As an illustration of the paid promotional features on the SAVVA platform, users can choose to pay in PLS tokens for various privileges that enhance their visibility and engagement. These paid features include:

* `Privileged Position in Promoted Lists:` Users have the option to pay for a privileged position within promoted lists. These lists can be found on various pages throughout the platform's interface, providing increased visibility and recognition for the featured content. Paying in PLS tokens for these premium placements allows authors to amplify the reach of their posts.

* `NFT Minting:` Minting an NFT for a post, which adds a layer of uniqueness to the content, also requires a payment in PLS tokens. This incentivizes users to utilize the NFT feature and contribute to the buy and burn process when creating NFTs for their posts.

* `Best Post of the Month:` The platform hosts features like selecting the 'Best Post of the Month' or similar recognition-based mechanisms. Users can pay in PLS tokens to participate in these programs, adding value to their content and encouraging higher-quality contributions.

These paid features not only enhance the visibility and engagement opportunities for users but also contribute to the buy and burn mechanism. When users make payments in PLS tokens for these services, the collected PLS tokens are funneled into the 'buy and burn' contract, leading to the acquisition and subsequent burning of SAVVA tokens. This process creates scarcity and value for the SAVVA token, benefiting the entire platform ecosystem.

By implementing these paid promotional features, the SAVVA platform provides users with the means to gain recognition, amplify their content, and actively participate in a deflationary mechanism that enhances the utility and value of the SAVVA token.
