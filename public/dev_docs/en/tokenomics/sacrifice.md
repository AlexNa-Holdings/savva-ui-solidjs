## Ongoing Sucrifice

The SAVVA platform introduces an innovative feature known as 'Ongoing Sacrifice,' designed to promote and support the freedom of speech. This mechanism operates on a weekly cycle, allowing individuals to express their support by sacrificing PLS tokens.

Here's how the 'Ongoing Sacrifice' process works:

1. Weekly Sacrifice: Every week, users have the opportunity to contribute PLS tokens as a form of support for the freedom of speech within the platform. This represents a collective commitment to fostering an open and inclusive environment.

2. Token Minting: At the end of each week, the system will initiate a token minting process, generating a total of `240,000` new SAVVA tokens.

3. Token Distribution: Half of the newly minted tokens will be distributed among the participants who sacrificed their PLS tokens during that week. This allocation rewards those who actively support the platform's principles.

4. Staking Contract: The remaining half of the minted tokens will be transferred to a staking contract, contributing to the platform's ecosystem and potentially facilitating additional rewards for participants through staking.

All the PLS tokens that have been collected as sacrifices will be transferred to an origin address with 'no expectation.' This transparent action ensures that the sacrificed PLS tokens are not utilized for any specific purposes and underscores the platform's commitment to integrity.

The 'Ongoing Sacrifice' mechanism on the SAVVA platform exemplifies a collective effort to uphold and promote the values of free speech and inclusivity. It not only rewards participants but also contributes to the platform's sustainability and continued growth, all while maintaining transparency and fairness in token distribution and usage.

The 'Ongoing Sacrifice' mechanism serves as the primary and sole deflationary mechanism within the SAVVA platform. It operates on the principle of generating a fixed number of tokens every week indefinitely. This unique approach ensures that the SAVVA token supply remains dynamic and responsive to the evolving needs of the platform and its community.

While the initial inflation rate for the SAVVA token is approximately `5% per year`, the absolute number of new tokens minted each week remains constant. As a result, the inflation rate gradually decreases over time. Here is a table projecting the minting of SAVVA tokens for the first 10 years:
