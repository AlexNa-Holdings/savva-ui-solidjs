## Governance

The SAVVA platform embraces a robust governance system that empowers token stakers to actively participate in shaping the platform's parameters and policies. Many crucial parameters, such as the allocation percentage of the post fund contribution to authors, NFT minting prices, payment round durations for the post fund, and more, are stored in a dedicated 'Config' contract.

Here's how the governance process works:

* `Parameter Control:` Various critical parameters that govern the platform's operations are stored in the Config contract. These parameters impact aspects like content rewards, NFT creation costs, and the overall platform experience.

* `Token Staker Participation:` Token stakers on the SAVVA platform have the opportunity to propose changes to these parameters. They can suggest alterations to existing settings or introduce new ones through the governance system.

* `Voting Process:` The Governance contract organizes a transparent and democratic voting process. Token stakers can vote on proposed changes, expressing their preferences and opinions regarding parameter adjustments.

* `Implementation of Approved Proposals:` If a proposal receives sufficient support through the voting process, it is enacted, and the Config parameters are updated accordingly. This means that the platform's rules and settings can be adapted to align with the evolving needs and desires of the SAVVA community.

Creating a proposal within the SAVVA platform's governance system comes with a price in the form of PLS tokens. When users initiate a proposal, they are required to pay a certain amount of PLS tokens as part of the proposal creation process. Importantly, the PLS tokens used for creating proposals are not retained by the platform or any centralized entity.

Instead, these tokens are transferred to the buy and burn contract, contributing to the ongoing 'buy and burn' mechanism within the platform. The 'buy and burn' contract systematically acquires SAVVA tokens and subsequently burns them, reducing the overall token supply. This process creates scarcity and value for the SAVVA token, benefiting the entire ecosystem.

In essence, users who participate in the governance system by creating proposals not only contribute to the decision-making process but also actively support the deflationary mechanism of the platform. It aligns with the platform's commitment to sustainability and community-driven value creation, where every action serves to benefit the token holders and the overall ecosystem.

The governance mechanism allows for collective decision-making and ensures that the platform remains adaptable and responsive to the community's input. It empowers token stakers to actively participate in shaping the SAVVA platform, fostering a sense of ownership and community-driven development
